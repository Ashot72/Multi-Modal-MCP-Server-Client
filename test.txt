Cursor Initial Prompt

Generate an index.html page that imports tailwind.css and chart.js if they do not already exist. The page should include a <div id="dynamic-content"> element, where tool content will be appended based on later prompts. The title of the file should be Multi Modal MCP, and the page should include a header with the same name and a blue background. Do not add any additional content—just the header. The width allocated for controls should be 710px. Do not generate JavaScript to add the content—insert it directly into the div element.



Cursor Project Rule (multi-modal-mcp.mdc)

*** When the videoTool is called, it returns a YouTube video ID. Please generate a YouTube URL based on the video ID and create an <iframe>:

<iframe
  width="700"
  height="394"
  src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`}
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  title="YouTube Video"
/>


*** When the documentTool is called, please display the content in cards. Note that the content may include multiple items.

*** When the chartTool is called, generate a pie chart structure based on the provided JSON structure

*** When the audioTool is called, create an HTML5 <audio> player to play the generated audio file.

*** When the imageTool is called, create an <img> tag with dimensions 512x512 and set the result as its source

After each successful tool call, append the result to the <div id="dynamic-content"> element.
